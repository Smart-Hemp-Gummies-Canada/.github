What Are Smart Hemp Gummies Canada?

Smart Hemp Gummies Canada are chewable edibles infused with hemp extract. Unlike CBD gummies, which are derived from the cannabis plant, these gummies contain hemp extract, which is sourced from the seeds and stalks of the hemp plant. This means they’re packed with beneficial compounds like cannabinoids (except THC), terpenes, and essential fatty acids, without the psychoactive effects associated with THC.

The main difference between hemp and CBD gummies lies in the concentration of cannabidiol (CBD). Hemp gummies usually contain a broader spectrum of hemp compounds, providing a more holistic approach to wellness.
